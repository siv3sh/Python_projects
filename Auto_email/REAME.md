# Email Sender Script

## Overview

This Python script allows you to send emails using the `smtplib` library. It connects to the Gmail SMTP server, authenticates with the provided credentials, and sends an email to a specified recipient with the content you provide.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Internet access
- A Gmail account (or other SMTP server credentials if not using Gmail)

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Gmail Configuration

1. **Enable Less Secure Apps**: If you are using a Gmail account, you need to enable access for less secure apps. Follow these steps:
   - Go to [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/security).
   - Under the "Less secure app access" section, enable access.

2. **App-Specific Password**: If you have two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled on your Gmail account, you need to generate an app-specific password:
   - Go to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security).
   - Under the "Signing in to Google" section, select "App passwords".
   - Generate a new app password and use it in place of your regular Gmail password in the script.

## Usage

1. **Clone or Download the Script**

   Clone the repository or download the script file to your local machine.

   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>

EXAMPLE 

Enter the email of the recipient:
recipient@example.com
Enter the content for the email:
Hello, this is a test email!



### Instructions:

1. **Placeholders**: Make sure to replace `<repository-url>`, `<repository-directory>`, and `your-email@example.com` with actual values relevant to your project.

2. **Script Name**: Ensure that the script name (`email_sender.py`) matches the name of your Python file.

3. **License**: Adjust the license section according to the actual license you choose for your project.

Save this content into a file named `README.md` in your project's root directory. This will provide clear instructions and documentation for users of your script.
